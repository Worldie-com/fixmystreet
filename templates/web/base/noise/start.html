Or you can ring 020 8356 3000 between 9.00am and 5.00pm Monday to Friday;

    <li>Friday 9.00pm-2.00am
    <li>Saturday 9.00pm-2.00am

</ul>

<p>Please first read the guidance on
<a href="https://hackney.gov.uk/noise">https://hackney.gov.uk/noise</a> to
understand what we can and cannot do about noise, and the types of noise that
are considered unwelcome.

<p>Legal action is likely to only be taken when the noise is ongoing. This is
because the noise has to be deemed a ‘statutory nuisance’ that materially
affects the comfort of your home, i.e. loud enough to wake you up at night
regularly, or prevent you from concentrating during the day.

<p>One-off incidents are unlikely to be considered for legal action, however,
you can still report them to the Council. An enforcement officer will contact
you for more details, and may visit the scene and serve an abatement notice to
stop the noise.

<p>To report noise, you will need to provide us with:

<ul>
    <li>Your address
    <li>Your phone number
    <li>An idea of the source of the noise
</ul>

<p>Your details are confidential unless court action is necessary. Please note
that anonymous complaints will not be taken as we need to know who is affected
by the problem.
